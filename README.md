# Pitch_and_Intensity_ranges
Praat script to plot the relation between Pitch and Intensity in speech.
This becomes a Phonetogram if used on sustained vowels tracing the 
extremes in pitch and loudness.

The script will plot a graph of Intensity versus Pitch from running 
speech using the center points of automatically segmented syllabels.

When the option "Phonetigram" is checked, every voiced frames (d=10ms)
will be used to draw the phonetogram. Only makes sense for sustained 
vowels tracing the pitch range (low-high) and the loudness range 
(soft-loud).
